# Initial Idea 

    - take a webcam picture
    - determine if picture is bright or dark based on the values of the rgb
    - save and keep checking if picture values changed 
    - if changed, change brightness based on the differnce 

# Notes for optimization

    - delete pictures after extracting info but save values in a somefile
    - use the video instead  

# Installing required things

    - cv2
